Image Enhancement 
=================

This is an example of enhancing a low contrast image containing noise.

The containing executable file is compiled for x86 architecture under Linux.

I've used OpenCV for reading and writing bmp files in this work, so any version of OpenCV will do since they share the same function for reading and writing files. (I'm using version 2.14.3) 

To compile
> **make** 

To run the executable
> **./[executable file name] [input file]**

Demo
----
**Input**
![Alt text](input4.bmp?raw=true "Input Image")
**Output**
![Alt text](output4.bmp?raw=true "Output Image")
